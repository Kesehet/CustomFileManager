# Developing Custom File Manager in Django Framework (Repl.it Instructions)

- Fork this template to get started
- Simply hit run to start the server
- The server will autoreload as needed. You need to restart the server manually on adding new data files (This is an issue we are still looking into)
## Add your first view

1. Add your files under "staticwriteonly" folder in the root directory:

```
main 
-staticwriteonly
--dataaudio1.mp3
--dataaudio2.mp3
```
